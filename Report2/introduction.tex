\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

This report is written at the IT University of Copenhagen in the spring term of 2013 in connection with a CUDA project supervised by Peter Sestoft from ITU and Hans Henrik Brandenborg SÃ¸rensen from DTU. The report is adressed to people interested in exploiting the benefits of using graphical processing units (GPUs) to optimise feasible computations in general, but specifically to people interested in CUDA.

In this project, we take a problem from the insurance industry that requires a significant amount of time to solve and show how to speed it up by moving the computations from the CPU to the GPU.
