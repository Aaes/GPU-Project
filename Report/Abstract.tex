%Abstract is the executive summary of the entire paper. As a summary it should encompass not only the main result, but also the problem, and the evaluation. Shaw [4] reports that good ICSE papers discussed evaluation already in their abstract. This is important in software engineering, because of the emphasis put on the evaluation of results.
%A good abstract is readable for non-experts, as it increases the chances that someone will build on your work (often application opportunities appear in other areas).
%I try to have four sentences in my abstract. The first states the problem. The second states why the problem is a problem. The third is my startling sentence. The fourth states the implication of my startling sentence.

%Simon Peyton Jones summarizes this idea in the following points

This report explores how utilizing CUDA C and general purpose graphics processing units can speed up the estimation of the size of the reserves needed in the Base Form 820 Collective Artificial Spouse Retirement Plan.\\

In its current state, this estimation takes approximately 20 minutes per insurance holder if a satisfactory approximation of the reserve is to be obtained. The parallelized solution presented in this paper makes it up to 670 times faster than the original solution, meaning that the previous 20 minute execution now takes 1.23 seconds. \\

The solution enables insurance companies to estimate the reserves for Base Form 820 much faster than previously, using relatively cheap hardware.
