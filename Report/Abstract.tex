Abstract is the executive summary of the entire paper. As a summary it should encompass not only the main result, but also the problem, and the evaluation. Shaw [4] reports that good ICSE papers discussed evaluation already in their abstract. This is important in software engineering, because of the emphasis put on the evaluation of results.
A good abstract is readable for non-experts, as it increases the chances that someone will build on your work (often application opportunities appear in other areas).
I try to have four sentences in my abstract. The first states the problem. The second states why the problem is a problem. The third is my startling sentence. The fourth states the implication of my startling sentence.

Simon Peyton Jones summarizes this idea in the following points
