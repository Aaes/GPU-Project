%Abstract is the executive summary of the entire paper. As a summary it should encompass not only the main result, but also the problem, and the evaluation. Shaw [4] reports that good ICSE papers discussed evaluation already in their abstract. This is important in software engineering, because of the emphasis put on the evaluation of results.
%A good abstract is readable for non-experts, as it increases the chances that someone will build on your work (often application opportunities appear in other areas).
%I try to have four sentences in my abstract. The first states the problem. The second states why the problem is a problem. The third is my startling sentence. The fourth states the implication of my startling sentence.

%Simon Peyton Jones summarizes this idea in the following points

This paper explores how utilizing CUDA C and general purpose graphic processing units can make the calculation of reserves for the Base Form 820 Collective Artificial Spouse Retirement Plan, faster. \\

In its current state this calculation take more than 20 minutes per customer if a decent approximation of the reserve is to be achieved. The parallelized solution presented in this paper makes it up to INDSÆT TAL times faster than the original solution, meaning that the previous 20 minute execution now takes INDSÆT TAL seconds. \\

The solution enables insurance companies to estimate the reserves for Base Form 820 using relatively cheap hardware, much faster than previously.
