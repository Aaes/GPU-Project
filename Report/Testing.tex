To make sure that the C\#, C and CUDA programs produced similar results up to an acceptable threshold, we ran each program on a set of data and compared the outputs. Each of the three programs take four command line arguments which is $g$, $r$, $x$ and number of steps per year. Each program outputs a single number which is the $y$-value of the final point from the outer model. This number denotes the reserver needed at calculation time to be able to fulfill present and future obligations. \\

We wanted all input from the test data set to fall within intervals chosen realistically and individually for each command line argument. It made little sense to test the three programs with a retirement age of 130 since few people experience to become that old. Likewise, few people take out insurances when they are 10 years old. To avoid these problems, we made a program that generated test data in the shape of a plain text file. Each row in the file contained a comma separated list of numbers representing the four command line arguments to be fed to each of the three programs. \\

Next, we needed a program that read the lines of the test data file one by one, invoked the three programs in sequence and appended the results to a file. This could be done by a single program, but we wished to be able to test the C\#, C and CUDA implementations separately during development without having to wait for the other two to finish, which might take longer time than the single implementation we wanted to test. For that reason, we made a test program for each of the three implementations that is private to the implementation being tested. \\

Running all three test programs produced three text files with the result from each test run. These could then be imported into three columns in a spread sheet and be compared to each other to identify matching and differing results. \\

The test scenarios described above was conducted on three machines with the following hardware specifications:

For testing purposes we assume that the insurance holder is always a woman and the spouse is always a man as mentioned in section \ref{assumptions}. The individual test results can be found in Appendix \ref{app:rawdata}.
