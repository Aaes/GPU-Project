In this project, we have taken a well-defined computing task from the life insurance instrustry and shown how to speed it up using parallisation with CUDA. The problem consisted of estimating the size of the reserves that the insurance company needs to have available at any time during the life of a policyholder to be able to honour its obligations to his or her spouse in case the policyholder dies.
