In this project, we took a well-defined computing task from the life insurance industry and showed how to speed it up using parallization with CUDA. The problem consisted of estimating the size of the reserves that an insurance company needed to have available at any time during the life of an insurance holder to be able to fulfill its obligations to his or her spouse in case the insurance holder died.\\

The goal of the project was to parallelize the estimation of the reserve for the Base Form 820 using CUDA C in order to decrease the running time significantly. To achieve this goal, we implemented a C version of the provided C\# implementation which we later changed into two CUDA C implementations. We tested the precision and performance of all implementations and found that the OuterPar implementation was by far the fastest and performed 670 times faster than the provided C\# implementation. In terms of precision, OuterPar deviated from the Edlund estimation by approximately 0.05\%.\\

The project was considered a success since the goal of optimizing the running time significantly was reached and the deviation between the result from OuterPar and the result from Edlund is small.
