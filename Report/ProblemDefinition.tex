%- Description of the insurance math used in the current solution \\

In this project we aim to decrease the time it takes to estimate the reserve required to fulfill the obligations to a single insurance holder. To do this we define the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Implement a fixed step Runge-Kutta 4th order solver in C based the original C\# implementation.
	\item Analyze opportunities for parallelization of the C implementation.
	\item Implement the result of the analysis in CUDA C.
	\item Test, benchmark and compare the results from the CUDA C and C implementations to the original C\# implementation.
\end{itemize}

These steps will help us answer the question of how CUDA C can be utilized to optimize the estimation of the Base Form 820 Collective Artificial Spouse Pension Plan using the Runge-Kutta 4th order method.
