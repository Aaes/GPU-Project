%- Description of the insurance math used in the current solution \\

The scope of this project is to handle a single insurance holder at a time. We do not explore the possibilities for optimizing the implementation for several insurance holders at a time but discuss it briefly in Section \ref{futurework}. Neither do we explore alternative methods for numerically solving differential equations, except for Simpsons Rule which we briefly discuss.
