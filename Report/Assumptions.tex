%- Description of the insurance math used in the current solution \\

This project was developed under several assumptions to limit its size. We assumed that the spouse of an insurance holder was always of the opposite gender. It would be possible to take same-gender couples into account but it would require some modification to the code which is discussed in future work. We assumed that the interest rate is always 5 \%. Furthermore we assume that the stepsize, grace period, retirement age and the age of the insurance holder at the time of calculation used in the Runge-Kutta solver is always a positive integer.
