%- Description of the insurance math used in the current solution \\

This project was developed under several assumptions to limit its size. We assumed that the spouse of an insurance holder was always of the opposite gender. It would now be possible to take same-gender couples into account but it would require some modification to the code. We assumed that the  interest rate is always 5 \%. We assume that the stepsize used in the Runge Kutta solver is always a positive integer.
