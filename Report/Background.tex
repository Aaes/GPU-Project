\subsection{Problem definition}
How can CUDA C be utilized to optimize the calculation of the baseform 820 collective artificial spouse retirement plan using the Runge Kutta 4th order method?

\subsection{Scope}
	The scope of this project is to handle a single customer at a time. We do not explore the possibilities for optimizing the process of using the algorithm on several customers at a time. Neither do we explore alternative methods for numerically solving differential equations.
	
\subsection{Assumptions}
This project was developed under several assumptions to limit its size. We assumed that the spouse of an insurance holder was always of the opposite gender. It would now be possible to take same-gender couples into account but it would require som modification to the code. We assumed that the  interest rate is always 5 \%.
