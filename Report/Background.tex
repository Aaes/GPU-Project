As mentioned in the introduction, the mathematical model from the insurance company estimates the size of the reserve needed to fulfill the obligations to the spouse of the insurance holder at any time between signing of the policy and until the entire pension has been disbursed.\\ 

The payment to the spouse will be in the form of a life annuity which is disbursed from the time of death of the insurance holder, unless the death occurs before the retirement age ($r$), in which case the life annuity will be disbursed after a grace period ($g$) determined by the insurance company at the time the insurance was signed. If the insurance holder dies after the retirement age, but within $g$ years, the annuity is disbursed at the time $r + g$. \\

If the insurance holder is not married at the time of death, the insurance is forfeited. If the spouse of the insurance holder dies during the grace period the insurance is forfeited. If the spouse dies before the insurance holder, the insurance is forfeited but the insurance holder still has the opportunity to find a new spouse and resume the previous state of the insurance. \\

%In this project we were given a mathematical specification for calculating this reserve \cite{edlu} and a C\# implementation to match the specification. Our task was to convert the C\# implementation to the C programming language and then to the CUDA C extension. The CUDA C implementation should use the GPGPU parallelization options to speed up the calculation of the reserver. \\

The result of running the final solution with the appropriate input parameters will be a series of points denoting the reserve needed for the insurance company to fulfill all current and future obligations to the insurance holder.
